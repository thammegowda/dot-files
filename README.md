# Dot Files

This is a repository of config files I collected from web to improve my productivity.
NOTE: I didnt create the configs, I collected them, maybe customized a bit for my usecase. 
So full credits to original authors. 

The goak is to be able to quickly setup work place on new machines. 


## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thammegowda/dot-files.git ~/dot-files
# add the bashrc inside this repo to the ~/.bashrc
echo "source ~/dot-files/.bashrc" >> ~/.bashrc
```
